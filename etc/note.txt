#### Configuration Options 

consensus:
 1: FlatWorm

RBC Type:
 0: RBC
 1: ECRBC (FlatWorm)

Notes on maliciousMode: This configuration denotes the experiments we conducted for the failure scenarios.
 0: 0--(f-1) are the malicious modes that always vote 0 in ABA
 1: (2f+1)--(3f) are the malicious nodes that always vote 0 in ABA
 2: malicious nodes don't propose RBC instance
 3: malicious nodes always vote the opposite value (XOR 1) in ABA

 Use different combinations of consensus and RBC Type to run different protocols


### Run the protocols: 

Use different combinations of consensus and RBC to run different protocols. 
Please refer to the paper for more details.
